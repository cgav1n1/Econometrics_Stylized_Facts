INSTRUCTIONS for students/groups
 This assignment can be solved either individually or in groups of maximum 4 students. Therefore, the admissible number of students per group are: 1, 2 3, and 4.
Groups of 5 or more students are not allowed.
In the following I will generically speak about a “group”, implicitly also considering the special case of a group composed of only 1 student. The students are free to decide among themselves the composition of the groups. Professors and EDHEC / Master admin are not responsible, nor involved for the formation of the groups.
Note: in the past very unpleasant situations between group components, involving heavy “free riding accusations” happened when groups have been randomly imposed by the professor for this course. Therefore, we have opted for this choice of leaving the student free to decide/organize the groups composition. As adults and professionals, it is your responsibility to find a group of people that you trust and to contribute significantly to the group project. Remember that you always have the option of forming your own individual group.
Each group must submit ONE unique file with the answer to the assignment in electronic format (.DOC, or .DOCX, or .PDF) through the dedicated link in Blackboard. Only one of the group members will submit the solution.
The final grade of the assignment answer will be shared by all the components of the group, and will count for 40% of their final grade for this course.
You must indicate the names, surnames and “student number” of ALL the components of the group on the top of the first page of your answers. If the above information is not provided for one student, that student will receive a grade of 0.
You must answer Question 1, respecting the following page number limit and rules:
- Question 1: answer must be provided in maximum 9 pages.
- Python code used to answer Question 1 must be provided in an Appendix at the end of the answer
to Question 1, and there is no page number limit for the Appendix containing the Python code. The answer to Questions 1, and the Appendix with the Python code must be included in one
unique file in one of the following three formats: .DOC, or .DOCX, or .PDF .
QUESTION 1 [ Points : 20 out of 20 ]
INSTRUCTIONS
You must answer this question by generating tables / graphs using the software Python. You must insert the tables / graphs you generated, relevant formulas and the commentary to them in maximum 9 pages. Only the first 9 pages with the answer to this question will be graded, and all the additional pages (10th, 11th etc.) will not be graded.
The Python code used to generate all the empirical results provided for this answer should be copy-pasted in an Appendix to the submitted final file, to be placed after all the answer to the question. There is no page number limit for the Python code of this Appendix. The title of this Appendix must be ``APPENDIX: Python code for Question 1’’.

PRELIMINARY STEP 1
 Download one time series of at least 25 consecutive years of daily Adjusted Prices from Yahoo Finance website of either one stock or one stock market index from the stock market in one of the following countries:
- USA
- Australia
- Belgium
- Canada
- France
- Germany
- Italy
- Netherlands
- Sweden
- Switzerland
- United Kingdom
Your sample of at least 25 years of consecutive daily data must include the entire year 2023, and must end on the last trading day of the year 2023 (that is at the end of December 2023).
You are allowed to use either one stock of a company, or one stock market index representing the stock markets (or a segment of the stock markets, for instance the index of energy stocks) of these countries, as long as the data can be downloaded from Yahoo Finance using Python, as we have done in ``Lecture 1: Financial Returns: Description and Stylized Facts’’.
You cannot use the following indexes / stocks: S&P500, DOW JONES (DJIA), IBM, TESLA.
Any choice of your sample/data not compliant with the above instructions will cause a heavy penalization on your grade of this question.
PRELIMINARY STEP 2
At the beginning of your answer to Question 1, indicate clearly:
- the name and the exact ticker of stock or index you are considering,
- the length of your sample (number of days, months, years),
- the initial and final dates of your sample, and
- the stock market and country in which the stock you selected is traded, or to which the stock index you selected refers to.
Using the time series you downloaded in PRELIMINARY STEP 1, compute the log-returns at daily, monthly, and annual frequencies and present a table of summary statistics of these three series of returns. The table should be similar to the one appearing in slide n. 91 of the set of slides titled ``Lecture 1: Financial Returns: Description and Stylized Facts’’.
ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION
Does the time series you have downloaded following the preliminary steps present features in line with all the 8 Stylized Facts of financial prices / returns discussed in ``Lecture 1: Financial Returns: Description and Stylized Facts’’?
Explain carefully your answer for each of the 8 stylized facts by using additional computations, tables and graphs done/generated using the software Python and the data you have downloaded/computed following the two preliminary steps. You are free to decide the right mix of tables, graphs, formulas and comments needed to answer this question.
